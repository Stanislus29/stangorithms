```stangorithms``` is a repository which contains algorithmic implementations of mathematical processes used in electronics engineering and computer science. The repo was created to provide students 
with a practical framwork with which they can implement computationally the mathematical models they learn in the classroom. 

Whilst designed for learning, the frameworks within this repo can also be used by engineers to automate cumbersome low-level design tasks, or build new CAD software. 

The repo contains frameworks for automating solving process in various domains; 
- Analog Electronics
- Digital Electronics
- Neural Networks
- Embedded Systems
