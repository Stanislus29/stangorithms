  "title": "StanLogic: A Python Package for Boolean Simplification and Logic Computation",
  "description": "StanLogic is a Python package dedicated to Boolean expression simplification and logical reasoning. It provides computational tools that bridge mathematical formalism and algorithmic implementation for digital logic, electronics, and computer science education. The package includes KMapSolver for deriving minimal SOP and POS expressions for 2-4 variable Karnaugh Maps with support for don't-care conditions and efficient bitmask operations.",
